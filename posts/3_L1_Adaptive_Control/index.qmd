Aerial robots are required to remain operational even
in the event of system disturbances, damages, or failures to ensure
resilient and robust task completion and safety. One common
failure case is propeller damage, which presents a significant challenge in both quantification and compensation. In this letter, we
propose a novel adaptive control scheme capable of detecting and
compensating for multi-rotor propeller damages, ensuring safe and
robust flight performances. Our solution combines an L1 adaptive
controller with an optimization routine for damage inference and
compensation of single or dual propellers, with the capability to
seamlessly transition to a fault-tolerant solution in case the damage
becomes severe. We experimentally identify the conditions under
which the L1 adaptive solution remains preferable over a fault tolerant alternative. Experimental results validate the proposed
approach demonstrating the ability of our solution to adapt and
compensate onboard in real time on a quadrotor for damages even
when multiple propellers are damaged.
