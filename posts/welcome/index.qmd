To me robotics is a fascinating discipline that combines engineering, computer science, and artificial intelligence. ie its the coolest thing ever. As a member of the Agile Robotics and Perception Lab(ARPL) at NYU I have the opportunity to work with this cutting edge technology. 

I will be using this blog to post about projects I'm working on or even random things I find interesting. I have a lot of plans in store for this summer, so I am writing this blog as a record of everything I'm doing. I'm halfway through my Masters in Mechatronics and Robotics and this blog has been a long time coming. 


I believe that robotics has the power to revolutionize the way we live, work, and interact with the world around us. Through this blog, I wish to share my passion for robotics and record my journey through this vast field.

So, buckle up and get ready to embark on a thrilling journey into the realm of robotics. Let's explore the limitless possibilities and discover the future that robots hold for us all.
