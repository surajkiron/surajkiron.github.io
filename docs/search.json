    "text": "This is the first blog post. Welcome!\n\nTo me robotics is a fascinating discipline that combines engineering, computer science, and artificial intelligence. ie its the coolest thing ever. As a member of the Agile Robotics and Perception Lab(ARPL) at NYU I have the opportunity to work with this cutting edge technology.\nI will be using this blog to post about projects I’m working on or even random things I find interesting. I have a lot of plans in store for this summer, so I am writing this blog as a record of everything I’m doing. I’m halfway through my Masters in Mechatronics and Robotics and this blog has been a long time coming.\nI believe that robotics has the power to revolutionize the way we live, work, and interact with the world around us. Through this blog, I wish to share my passion for robotics and record my journey through this vast field.\nSo, buckle up and get ready to embark on a thrilling journey into the realm of robotics. Let’s explore the limitless possibilities and discover the future that robots hold for us all."

    "section": "Background:",
    "text": "Background:\nThe goal of this project was to perform a PID reactive control capable of following the line painted on a racing circuit. PID control is one of the fundamental concepts of Linear control systems. The Controller continuously calculates an error value as the difference between desired output and the current output and applies a correction based on proportional, integral and derivative terms(denoted by P, I, D respectively). The control signal u[k] for a PID controller can be expressed as follows. \n\nProportional:\nProportional Controller gives an output which is proportional to the current error. The error e[k] is multiplied with a proportional gain(Kp) to get the output. And hence, is 0 if the error is 0.In this case the error is the difference between the center of the image and the centroid of the racing line.\n\n\nIntegral:\nIntegral Controller provides a necessary action to eliminate the offset error which is accumulated by the P Controller.It integrates the error over a period of time until the error value reaches to zero.\n\n\nDerivative:\nDerivative Controller gives an output depending upon the rate of change or error with respect to time. It gives the kick start for the output thereby increasing system response.\nThe integral and dervivative errors are calculated as follows."

    "text": "Tuning the PID controller.\nFirstly, we must setup the P controller as per Ziegler Nichols method. Keep adjusting the value of the constant, till we get a value where there occurs it has neither unstable oscillations and nor slow response.   \nOnce you get oscillations of constant amplitude you can adjust the derivative gains (Kd). After this the vehicle was much more stable and tracked the line accurately. Finally I modified the Integral gain which I found to have minimal effect on the system. But nonetheless helped to avoid any steady state errors."

    "text": "Learning\nOne mistake I made was to set the velocity of the car too high. Since the cycle time of the system is only 12Hz the controller could not detect the change in error fast enough. This led to understeer and multiple head on collision with the track walls. It’s always a good idea to start with the minimal speed requirement when programming a controller and increase it once the system is more robust."
